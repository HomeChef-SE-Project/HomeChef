# HomeChef
Home-Makers deserve a platform to reap the benefits of the work they do, at the comfort of their own house. People like Migrants who shifted from their hometowns, miss their domestic food and the culture & can't find the right substitute; Bachelors who canâ€™t cook their own food or afford to order restaurant food every day; People who wish to order indigenous food items like Pickles, Sweets, Namkeen, etc. which are particularly famous at their places. There is no current work system that brings together these two sections of people and Our project aims to form a bridge between these two sections which can greatly benefit both the groups.
